Course materials for Fundamentals of Data Science 

* Fork this repo

* The topics of each week's lectures are described in the syllabus PDF 

* Lectures are in directories named XY/ where XY/ is the number of the week

* Homework assignments are similarly in the homework/ directory - there are instructions in there for submitting your work

* Solutions to homework assignments will be posted over the weekend after the Thursday they were due

* Various help cheat sheets are included in help/. 

* You should also review in-class notebooks and homework solutions to make sure you understand what is happening

* The lecture notebooks have in-class exercises for you to work on

If you are working on a fork of the repo, and pull request to commit homework
solutions, the problem is that git will pick up any other changes that you
comitted, including to the in-class exercises. The solution is to work on your
homework in the `master` branch of your forked repo, but keep a separate
*branch* of the repo for in-class exercises. I'd name the branch something like
your FirstName_LastName as with your homework. See the `update.sh` script for
keeping your `master` branch up-to-date. The procedure is similar for any other
branch - just `git checkout <BranchName>` first.
